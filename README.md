# AngelsBox Leverless Controller

A custom-designed leverless controller for fighting games, inspired by the Flatbox project. This project includes PCB designs created in KiCad and 3D models designed in Fusion 360. Keyboard part footprints from external repositories are utilized for precision and compatibility.

## Features

- **Custom PCB Design**: Designed using KiCad, tailored for leverless controller configurations.
- **3D Models**: Created in Fusion 360 for the case and structural components.
- **Keyboard Compatibility**: Leveraging community-driven footprints for key switches and other keyboard-related parts.
- **Fighting Game Optimized**: Designed with ergonomics and precision in mind for competitive play.

## Contents

1. **PCB Design**:
   - KiCad project files for the controller PCB.
   - Schematic and layout files.
   - Gerber files ready for manufacturing.

2. **3D Models**:
   - Fusion 360 files and exported STL models.
   - Case and structural parts for assembly.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Build instructions and assembly tips.
   - Information about external repositories used for keyboard footprints.

## Requirements

- **KiCad**: For viewing and editing PCB design files.
- **Fusion 360**: For modifying or inspecting the 3D models.
- **3D Printer**: To print the case and other structural parts.
- **PCB Manufacturer**: To fabricate the PCB using the provided Gerber files.

## Setup and Assembly

1. **PCB Fabrication**:
   - Send the provided Gerber files to your preferred PCB manufacturer.

2. **3D Printing**:
   - Print the STL files using a 3D printer.
   - Ensure proper filament material based on desired durability and aesthetics.

3. **Assembly**:
   - Solder components onto the fabricated PCB.
   - Assemble the 3D-printed case and secure the PCB inside.
   - Install key switches and other hardware components.

4. **Testing**:
   - Connect the controller to a compatible device.
   - Verify inputs and functionality through fighting game or test software.
